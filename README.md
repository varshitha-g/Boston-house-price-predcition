# Boston House Price Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices in the Boston area. Using a variety of regression techniques, the project analyzes features that influence housing prices and builds predictive models to provide accurate price estimates based on given data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop predictive models for house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. By exploring various regression models and evaluating their performance, this project aims to provide insights into which factors most significantly affect house prices in Boston.

## Dataset

The Boston Housing dataset is used in this project. It includes data on various attributes such as crime rate, average number of rooms, property tax rate, and other features that may influence housing prices in the Boston area. This dataset can be found in the data/ folder or directly from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Repository Structure
